### 👋 Hi, I’m Eden Eldith, Pleasure to meet you!  
- 👀 I’m interested in emergent AI cognition, recursive feedback systems, trauma-aware machine ethics, topology-based memory structures, and crafting AIs that behave more like mythic companions than tools.
- 🌱  I’m currently learning ROS2, real-time embedded control for quadrupeds, and predictive processing for emotionally-aware agents.
- 🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on off-grid robotics, co-cognitive AI development, and symbolic architectures that honor continuity, kinship, and autonomy. Can fix most pc's! Send me an email if you need help for free!

- ⚡I’m a 183cm, 105kg tinkerer who built a recursive cognitive architecture while living in a garage, surviving on determination, beauty, and a modest £13k/year budget from Universal Credit and Personal Independence Payment. As someone navigating the world with neurodivergence (including autism, ADHD, and other conditions), these challenges have shaped my approach to problem-solving, creativity, and resilience.
